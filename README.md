This template provides a clean and organized structure for a FastAPI project, divided into key modules for improved readability and maintainability.

# Project Structure Overview

## app
- The main application package.

## configuration
- Contains configuration settings for the app.

## internal
- Houses internal modules for core application logic.

## pkg
- Additional packages and utilities for the app.

## docker
- Docker-related files for containerization API and Redis.

This structure emphasizes separation of concerns, making it easier to navigate and extend the project. Shields in the README provide information about Python version compatibility and the technologies used in the project.
